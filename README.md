# Funding "Qu√©bec"projects and  developpers

Scan repositories contributed to or by [users followed by `ghqc`](https://github.com/ghqc?tab=following) for `/.github/FUNDING.yml` files and see what comes out.

See [funds.json](funds.json) for the initial results.

## Caveats

* Forks and originals and computed alike
* A maximum of 200 repositories per user are taken into account

## Some stats

### General

* 19,000 users
* 210,000 repositories
* 600 valid `FUNDING.yml` files
* Less than 0.3% of repositories had `FUNDING.yml` file

### Funding platforms

*Oups, I skipped liberapay in my calculations. Stay tuned...*

* 35.8% custom
* 29.1% patreon
* 24.8% open_collective
* 5.4% ko_fi
* 4.6% tidelift

## What's next?

* French (doh!)
* Charts
* Data updates
* Use Etags (querying 210,000 URLs takes a toll)
